On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, it's so comforting quiet
You read so softly over my head
It's late but I'm maintaining interest in the things that you say
I could listen to you speak all day

In the silence dripping wet with
Kisses running down my lips
Could be just a good friend
Who knows at this point anyway

There's just something about the way you surrender your eyes
Without this barrier of bodies, we'd already be inside

Like two children at first glance
We're building castles in the sand
It is so delicately dreamt of
This immediate intimacy

On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, I was thinking
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
Not this time anyway
Doo do doo...

I've got a feeling buried deep down inside of me
I've got a feeling buried deep down
And who knows what it means to have a feeling
Buried so deep down
But I've never felt quite so open for love
I've never felt quite so open before
And maybe my imagination runs away with me

You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind at all
Oh no... at all
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh no...
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh... my heart
Oh... my heart

Maybe you know that it's been too long
Going through the motions as you sing your song
Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done
Still got to wake up and be someone
Still got to wake up and be someone

I don't care what the papers say
It's just another intern with a resumé
I am going to fall in love with you some day
I'm gonna fall in love and run away
I'm gonna fall in love and run away

Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just want to be alive, make something real
Doesn't matter who you are or what you do
Something in the work will make a fool of you
Something in the work will make a fool of you

Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time
Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time


Coming from an endless place
Heaven hits me when I see your face
I go blind, every time

Hate to have to watch you go
Thought I'd been through this
Lord knows, I've been trying, I'm still trying

You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine

But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
I would watch you, look right through me
Right through every word that I say

He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do

But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
Yes, I would watch you, learn to love you
And her, too, if you'd only stay, but

You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine

He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do

But I will turn and walk away
I will watch you turn and walk away 

I ain't hanging up this time
I ain't giving up tonight
Even if you walk around
As though you think you're right
At your worst you still believe
It's worth the fight

I could make it all go away
Tell me what you think
And don't delay
We could still be having some
Sweet memories
This heart still beats for you
Why can't you see?

Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Stop your crying
It's alright
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight

Stop pretending I'm not there
When it's clear I'm not going anywhere
If I'm out of sight then take another look around
I'm still out there hoping to be found

Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Stop your crying
It's alright
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight

I could make it all disappear
You could feed me all of your fears
We could end all this pain right here
We could rewind all of those tears

I could take it down to the floor
You don't have to feel it anymore
A love so real that it can't be ignored
It's all over baby but I'm still young
I'm still young

Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Stop your crying
It's alright
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight
Shut up kiss me
Hold me tight 
Hurts to be around you
I can't stand to hear your lying


My watch is blurry when I look down at my hands
I'm just another, alive with impossible plans
I turn the lights low but we both know where we are
And when it's over, what becomes of your pure heart?

A love that never seems to curse or to confine
Will be forever never lost or too defined
To lose the feeling of an endless searching through
How to have made what is never about me or you
That is the kind of love I'd always dreamed to be
However painful, let it break down all of me

'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
Becoming true
Becoming true
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Become a prophet
Become a fool

I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
May the best of you win
Who is your truest friend?
Are they there at your end?
I'll let the light be black
And let some tears be shed
Do it all over again
I'll let the light shine in

It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna break you, it's just gonna shake you
Shake you alive
Baby
Oh, baby

I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
May the best of you win 
Whenever you're beside me
A part of me is dying

And every time I see you
I tell myself I'll never
Have this feeling with another


I've seen you changing
I've seen you changing

Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me
Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me

Or was it your mother?
Or was it your shelter?
Or was it another
With a heart shaped face
Got a heart shaped face
Was it a feeling you thought I could dig up or erase?

I've seen you changing
I've seen you aging
And I learned how to turn my head
And I learned how to walk away
And the truth never really lives
In the story of words we say

You never needed anyone to expose you to yourself
And you never needed anyone to raise you hell out of your mind

I never wanted to be someone who had to leave it all behind
Even still there is no escape for what I face, I faced before
Have whatever love you wanna have
But I can't be here anymore

There is nothing new
Under the sun
There is nothing new
Under the sun

Heartache ends
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
And begins again
And begins again
And begins again
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
And begins
And begins
Begins

Oh, you're in my heart forever

What is it you think I need
Everything
It's not true

Give it all up for you
Give it all up for you

Want to touch you
Show you how it feels
Whenever you're around
Take my time with you, my love

You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I really love

In my arms and fast asleep
In my arms and all my dreams
Where you are is where I want you
Where you are is where I want to
Where you are is where
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be

Saw it in her eyes
Oh, it wasn't what she said
She came together like a dream
That I didn't know I had
From the sleeping life I lead
All the colors I have seen
I can't help but recognize
The brighter one in front of me
Oh, the truth I thought I learned
And then it finally came along
Turned around and then it's there
All the love I thought was gone

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Piece us together
Know it's forever
Show me the future
Tell me you'll be there
I want to go where
Nobody knows fear
I want to follow
My heart down that wild road

Everywhere I go
I can see your face
Alive and gone at once
Hey, that's the way I see this place
And though this blessing was a curse
Before I opened up my heart
You learn to take it as it comes
You fall together, fall apart

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Live it through your eyes
Piece us together
Know that this wild road
Will go on forever
I want to live life
I want to die right

Next to you
Next to you
Next to you

All my life I thought I'd change
All my life I thought I'd change
All my life I thought I'd change


Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
And you kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all of the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find

See how you're laughing with those you don't know as well
I hear you saying I'm the one but I wish I could tell
Funny how time can can make you realize and realize
And then realize

But I'll take all of it
Don't want to leave it behind
I'll take all of it
If it's only real in my mind
Real in my mind
Real in my mind

Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you, will you, will you?
Even if it's all of my own
All of my own

Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
And you kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all of the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find 

All those people, they don't see me
Baby, don't leave
Please believe me
Couldn't love 'em if I tried to
No one understands me like you

I'm not playing anymore
I'm not playing anymore
Did all that before
I'm not playing anymore

Love of the chase
Love of love
What is it my heart's made of?
Don't you know you'll never have a part
Please don't start
It hurts to start
Dreaming, dreaming
Oh
Again
Again
Again

After it all ends
We'll be just like friends
Hey, what was that passing us by?
Hey, it was only something in my eyes

You can go on home, you got what you need
Take my heart and put it up on your sleeve
Tear it up so they can all sing along
Live out your life
I'll never tell you you're wrong
Baby, don't forget, don't forget it's our song
I'll be the thing that lives in the dream when it's gone
I'll be the thing that lives in the dream when it's gone

At first it wasn't light
I went along for the ride
I was a fly on your wall
To see the height of it all

I found a feeling inside
Or should I say it found me
I turned into someone I
Never imagined I'd be

Now I just can't take it back
Or I do anything but that
To have the glimpse of the dream
The vivid memory

A love never made is still mine
A love never made is still mine
A love never made is still mine
If only real in my mind
If only real in my mind
If only real in my mind

Want to be special, something like your mother
Want to be someone else, not me, but another
Right here in this moment, I wish I could reach you
I'm just a vessel, far away, I see you
Too many like us, run out of the steeple
Guess you could say I lost some faith in people

Want every thought to be golden or fire
I could be made out of truth, not some liar
Want to be tempered, sick to be tested
To see it all clearly, whenever it's rested
Want every lesson, the lessons they teach me
Someone who knows where I am, whenever they reach me

Give me a fever, show me some reason
Love me whenever it's out of season
Want to be special, something like your mother
Want to be someone else, not me, but another
But now in this moment, I wish I could meet you
But I'm just a balloon, far away, I see you
I see you
I see you

I see you, and it's unclear
I need you to show you're here
Tell me, I'm nothing to fear
Tell me, I'm nothing, nothing

You can love, you can love, you can lose
When it all looks the same
You can love, you can love, you can lose
When you're tired of playing

Here I am, there you are
I don't know where we're going
Or where we have been

I look back when I know
It's not there where I left
Have to find it again

Or the feeling I had when it had me
It was only with you
Here it is, there it goes
Was a force of its own just passing through

You can love, you can love, you can lose
When it all looks the same
You can love, you can love, you can lose
Even at your own game

You can look, you can look, you can see
What you wanted to see
All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is, you don't find it in me

All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is you don't find it in me
All your life you've been looking
Whatever it is you don't find it in me

You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me
You don't find it in me

It's all here
Now, it's all here
Now, it's all here
Now, it's always been here

It's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's always been right

You do not have to leave
Or go out walking too
You do not have to reach out
To somebody new
You do not have to hold her
In your fingertips
It's always been there with you
You are what it is

And it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's always been right
All right, all right
All right, all right

I hear you in my thoughts
I see you in my dreams
I know you're in my mind
And you are everything
Stay, and stay awhile
And still reminds
All be here
And start it

All right now
All right now

Every time I close my eyes
Something small within me dies
Can't say if it's dark or bright
But it's all I've ever known
And when I sleep, I sleep alone
Alone
Alone

Every time I take a breath
Something once living inside me has left
Yes it's alive but it's just passed through
It's just left me and it's just left you
On your own
On your own

And I love you most
I love you most
When I first found love in my soul
And I'll give to you
Give it up to you
When I first find it in myself
And the time will come for everyone
For everyone to know
Yes the time will come for everyone
For everyone to go

And say goodbye
And say goodbye
And say goodbye
Sweet dreams
Sleep tight
Sleep tight

On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, it's so comforting quiet
You read so softly over my head
It's late but I'm maintaining interest in the things that you say
I could listen to you speak all day

In the silence dripping wet with
Kisses running down my lips
Could be just a good friend
Who knows at this point anyway

There's just something about the way you surrender your eyes
Without this barrier of bodies, we'd already be inside

Like two children at first glance
We're building castles in the sand
It is so delicately dreamt of
This immediate intimacy

On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, I was thinking
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
Not this time anyway
Doo do doo...

I've got a feeling buried deep down inside of me
I've got a feeling buried deep down
And who knows what it means to have a feeling
Buried so deep down
But I've never felt quite so open for love
I've never felt quite so open before
And maybe my imagination runs away with me

You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind at all
Oh no... at all
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh no...
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh... my heart
Oh... my heart

Well It's Saturday night
You're all dressed up in blue
I've been watching you awhile
Maybe you've been watching me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're looking out for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they wanna have some Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe on their arm
Some girls want a sweet-talkin' Romeo
But around here baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're lookin' out for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Oh your road is dark
Yes it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
All your other boyfriends
They couldn't pass the test
So if you're lookin' out for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well I don't know maybe you've been around too
And when there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes
And if you're lookin' out for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
If you're you're lookin' out for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest

For you
I'd do anything for you, for you
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do for you
The stars were placed there for you, for you
Eternity flies on through and through for you
For you
For you

For you I'm cooked to you so rare
You are and someone's there to believe me
Never leave me
With you there's so many new things to be done

For you
With the tears in my eyes, for you
Happiness and love meets my cry, for you
Alone in my room for you
I'm brought out of the gloom
For you
For you

For you I'm cooked to you so rare
You are and someone's there to believe me
Never leave me
With you there's so many new things to be done

For you
With the tears in my eyes, for you
Happiness and love meets my cry, for you
Alone in my room for you
I'm brought out of the gloom
For you
For you
For you
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now

Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's all through and you're mine
All we ever wanted was a heart that kept on trying
Searching for some magic
Freeze from the thought of dying

Well, I'm feeling kinda tired
But I know it's for the best
Even when you're dreaming, you're not getting any rest
Grasping at the meaning of a love to call my own
Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone

Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's all through and you're mine
All we ever wanted was a heart that kept on trying
Find myself some magic
Freeze from the thought of dying

Feeling kinda tired
But I know it's for the best
Even when you're dreaming, you're not getting any rest
In the darker hour when you're far away from home
Never sure exactly of the last time you were known
Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone
Wish it were as easy as just picking up the phone

Time moves so strangely when you're moving all the time
Can't wait to see you, baby
When it's all through and you're mine
When it's all through and you're mine
When it's over and you're mine

Living out my life as though I knew how it was done
I have sat upon many a hillside in the sun
Same old feelings have their way of coming back around
Makes me wonder why I ever bother leaving town

All that time I was trying to be clever
Didn't know that I'd be loving you forever
All the years I spent chasing a meaning
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
When I can't just love a moment that's fleeting
When I can't just love a moment that's fleeting

How many disasters will it take to make you smile
Haven't seen you laughing at yourself in quite a while
People that you love that never learn how to speak with
Sometimes what you don't gain, it's another kind of gift

All that time I was trying to be clever
Didn't know that I'd be loving you forever
All the years I spent chasing a meaning
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating
How unfair to have a heart that's still beating

It may as well have been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind?
Is that my heart that's splitting open?
I guess it just fell to the side

I've tried my best to keep you smiling, love
Maybe it's been all in vain
But I would try a million times, my dear
Tell me would you do the same?

One could say it's complicated, love
Like nothing they've seen before
Or simply that it is a thought we share
Forever it must be ignored

If you really love me, there's no way to tell
I'm always arriving when you say farewell
In all of my dreams we are husband and wife
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life

Well, every road I see
Leads away from me
There's not a single one
That leads me home
The road keeps saying "Friend
Come see what's round the bend"
So is it any wonder that I roam?

All the places I have been
Keep calling me back again
Down in the pines
I hear the cold winds blow
My heart keeps telling me
"Footloose and fancy-free"
And the road goes by
And calls me as it goes

Well, maybe somewhere there's a someone
Waiting there with a smile
And maybe there'll be a place
To stop and rest awhile
And maybe you weren't meant to be
Just a rolling stone
And there's a road to travel on
That leads you back to home

Oh, but I'll keep travelling on
Keep looking at the dawn
Till I can lay this lonesome body down
And when that day has come
I nevermore will roam
And every road I see will lead me home

I quit my dreaming the moment that I found you
I started dancing just to be around you
Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more
I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door

I wanted nothing but for this to be the end
For this to never be a tied and empty hand
If all the trouble in my heart would only mend
I lost my dream I lost my reason all again

It's not just me for you, I have to look out too
I have to save my life
I need some peace of mind
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now

You may not be around
You may not be around
You may not be around

I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now

I feel so lonesome, I could cry
But instead I'll pass the time
Sitting lonely with somebody, lonely too
Well, there's nothing in the world I'd rather do

Now tell me if you don't feel this way
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there who believes
Sometimes believe
Not always believe
Sometimes believe.

Now we don't have to take it to extremes
We'll keep our hands our legs even our lips apart
But I'm giving you my heart, my heart
Are you giving me your heart?
Your heart
Are you lonely too?
Are you lonely too?

Hi-five, so am I
All of your life
Stuck in time
I'm stuck too
I'm stuck with you, do you, do you
I do, I do.

Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said

I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt

So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew up my eyes

I see an elevator, a moment I am above
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
The tight grip and the sun lick
And the calm weight of all things summer
When it's all here and it's all new
And you're not hungover

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are

My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change

If you've still got some light in you then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run

You're gone, you're gone
You're with me but you're gone
A feeling once so strong is now an old forgotten song
That you don't sing so high and wild

You're here you're here
But your spirit disappeared off to some place that I don't know
Some demon thing has squashed your soul and I don't recognize you

I wish that this could turn out pain to bliss
And we could put our fears aside and learn to laugh and be alive
And let our bodies be revived

But you can't say that you love me
How am I suppose to think that's the truth?
Well, has it ever been easy for you to stand behind the things that I do?

I want for this pass,
For us both to say at last
That on this dark and narrow path the sun is shining
And we
Remember what it is we're living for

I'm neither innocent or wise,
But when you look in my eyes,
You may as well be blind
You don't see me
Anymore.

And you can't tell me that you want me,
When I'm standing in your way...
Well this would all be so much easier
If I has nothing more to say.

If you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it, baby stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling it's true
No one's gonna make it for you

If you feel like quitting now, then try a little harder
The things we need the most they seem to take a little longer
No one's gonna try it for you, darling no one
No one's gonna wait there with you
Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out it shines
Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind

If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and laugh
If you've got a sense of humor, you're not so bad
No one's gonna hear it the same as it's said
No one's gonna listen to it straight from your head

If you feel like running out, then stand in one place
When you're still and when you run there's something to face
No one's gonna see your life through, there's no way
I wouldn't want to know what you see every day

If you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it baby, stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling it's true
No one's gonna wait there with you

Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out, it shines
Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind

I think you like to see me lose my mind
You treat me like a child I'm angry, blind
I feel so much at once that I could scream
I wish I had the voice of everything

To scream the animals to scream the earth
To scream the stars out of the universe
To scream it all back into nothingness
To scream the feeling 'til there's nothing left

I close my eyes and try to breathe for a while
You can change my mind with just a smile
And just before I turn to leave--I think
"I could use the thoughts you've given me"

To sing the animals to sing the earth
To sing the stars into our universe
To sing it all back into something new
To sing for life for myself maybe you

I close my eyes
And try to breathe for a while

If only all our memories were one
We only had to blink and it was done
If all the world could see it with one eye
In perfect color to the perfect sky

If only we could turn ourselves around
And all the things we're looking for were found
If only we grew wiser with each breath
If only we could dance our way to death

If only all our dreams were coming true
Maybe there'd be some time for me and you
If only all the world could sing along
In perfect rhythm to the perfect song

If only all our hopes were to be here
We'd just close our eyes when we want to disappear
If only all the love we needed was gained
If only we could always stay the same
If only we could always stay the same

We'd close our doors and then we'd go to bed
We'd never have to do it all again
There wouldn't be one thing to fight about
And time would turn our bodies inside out
And time would turn our bodies inside out

Thought I had a clue
It was passing by
Thought I had an answer
It was just a side
Thought I had a dream once
Don't remember what
Your voice cut straight through me
Right down to my bones

Like a winter's wind it
Knocked out my soul
Thought I had some time here
Left my watch at home
Thought I had ideas once
But they were all on loan

Thought I conquered something
Then it took me down
What I thought I heard clearly
It wasn't sound
Thought I felt your heartbeat
It was just my counting
Unto what thoughts will
My life be amounted

I can hear you crying
And I am crying, too
The world might be lying
But so are you

I can see you dancing
If you'd just take the step
You might still have it in you
Give yourself the benefit
And dance slow decades
Toward the sun
Even when you're the only one

Don't look around
It's not right
It's not wrong
Dance because you know the song
I dance because
I know this one

I need advice it's true
But I won't hear it from you
I don't remember when
You last cared for the things I did

I wish I could believe
Apply all the sides you've seen
Or you could be the only one
Who knows the truth of me

Am I the ugly one
It's easy to see past
All of the kindness that you've offered me
It doesn't last

It's just a thought I've had
If I could show you how
I came to think this way
Maybe you'd understand me now

Sometimes our enemies
Are closer than we think
Sometimes the ones we trust
May have to give up listening

I wish it were the same
As it is in my mind
I'd lie to learn a thing or two
Give me a reason why

Why am I not ashamed
While I am standing still
You want to move in me like you did before
But I've had my fill

You say your time has changed
That you have faced defeat
We might be older now
But is it changing anything

It could be in a way
We've learned to carry well
Oh how I wish I could
Remove this doubt I feel somehow

I want the best for you
So I won't look your way
Maybe the clouds will clear
And I'll be seeing you someday

I wish it were the same
As it is in my mind
I am lighter on my feet
When I've left some things behind

Won't you open a window sometime
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
Wind in your hair, sun in your eyes
Light
Light

We throw our shadows down
We must throw our shadows down
We live and throw our shadows down
It's how we get around
In the sun
In the sun

Why can't you see
Why can't you see
Why can't you see
Are you blind
Are you blind
Are you blind
Are you dead
Oh really
Are you all right
Are you all right

Won't you open a window sometime
Won't you open a window sometime
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
Wind in your hair, sun in your eyes
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light
What's so wrong with the light

You are the crazy acrobat
You are the witch
I am your cat
I want to be a bit like you
I hope you don't mind
If I do

I love the way your body's made
I love the way your voice is sex
To be the whisper upon your ear
I want to be the bed you miss

I am alive
I am alive
I thought
I thought that I died

Who cares?
I'm not a moralist
I'm just a lady with some time
I want to be made out of love
I want to be made into life

I love the way you take a walk
And the all the things you see with your eyes
Oh, to be that distant thought
Some growing meaning in your mind

I am alive
I am alive
I thought that I died
I thought that I died

Here you come along
I take a breath and remind myself that I too can be strong
Thought I was cool
Turns out I'm a fool
Clearly you've proved me wrong
I didn't know what I was missing when I was alone

And now I'm fruitlessly waiting for someone not thinking
Before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call

Well, I'm lost in my thoughts
They tumbled ahead
Over and over again
Yeah, it's true
Just take a look at what's been done to me
I wasted time to ponder
Here I am, oh, Alice in wonder
Partly I do this to myself
But why can't you see
The gesture is small
But know that it means the world to me
Forgive me for wanting
I'm only learning life
Forgiven myself and now there's no returning
I want to be the one who knows the best way
To love you

But now I'm foolishly waiting for
Someone not thinking before they start rushing to my door
Someone to run not walk
Someone to sing not talk
Oh, no hesitation at all
Sometimes I need you to be the one to call
I need you to be the one

I was safe when I was in the womb
I was warm when I was wrestling
To get out
Out of the flesh

And the sound of the world filled easily
And the eyes above watched eagerly
In the hopes of a name
In the hopes of a change
It was all bright, clear
It was all bright, clear

Deep in the nest of an endless dream
When a stranger thought becomes of me
It can slowly turn my blood
Just as the rings around our ever burning sun
Eventually wilt a once freshly blooming bud
It was all bright, clear
Oh, it was all bright, clear

Subtlely shedding back the years
And after it all we soon disappear
Yes, into the dark depths we all soon disappear
Out of this labyrinth that makes out/our, our world
How do we ever know the light inside ourselves?
To know that the skin that we wear is raw
That we can be anything if we know anything at all
Yes, we can be anything if we know anything at all

Bright, clear
And it was bright, clear

Your hands were cold
Your voice was shaky
One morning not too long ago
And at the time I was only a child
About to lose my childlike mind
The way you touched my hands
Like you never had before
It wasn't you anymore
I called for my brothers
I called for my sisters
But there was nothing left for them to do
And so I watched from far away
As the ambulances came
And started dressing for school

Goodbye sweet mother earth
Without you now I'm a lonely universe
You won't always understand
When you've truly loved someone
Until after they've gone

This time of year the nights fall longer
So grow a spine or catch cold
The winter months they do make you feel stronger
But in the end it's all getting old
And you won't always be walking the safest streets
But you can find your way home
If you have imagined your way back
Then my dear you're more than halfway there
And you might only possess
What you've carried on your back

But you've always been free
Now it's time to believe
Time to give up that unforgiving act of altogetherness
And start living out your oldest childhood dreams
Well, losing your minds it ain't half as bad as it seems
And if you would take the risk
Well, it might be worth your time
It's only your life
It's only going by

Goodbye sweet mother earth
Without you now I'm a lonely universe
You won't always understand
When you've truly loved someone
Until after they've gone

I don't mind if I am completely lost when I'm with you
I am always somewhat found in the things that we do together
I hope I can be somebody who shows you your heart
The way that it weighs upon my own
If only we could understand each other, I'd happily die
Oh, I don't care if I spend my whole life away
I'm gonna try to give to you all of the love that I've been shown before

Can't wait until tomorrow so that I can know you more
So that I can know you more
So that I can know you more
With all my life, my might
Turn all my dark into light
Take all of the hate in my mind and put it aside
Put it aside

All the places I've known and the faces I've seen over time are unseen and unknown
When you live in the dark and you start to believe that everyone is asleep in the same way that you are
Half life and half dream and half crazy to believe in anything at all 

I thought I knew it well
In my mind I knew well
What I wanted you to be
In this world I know the love it never is what it is to me
And it's always half strange to believe in anything
Half way insane and half way home in your arms

Always love
Always, always love
Like no other love
Like no other love I'd known before

I thought surely I would not find it again
How I was wrong
It is as fateful as sin
This feeling that I belong to something in some way
'Til the end
And I am making an effort to stay
With you here it has been easy to say
That I could never lose sight of what my heart truly is

I thought this time last year I'd be dead
It's quite strange the thoughts that pop into your head
When you're busy smiling surrounded by your closest of friends
It is impossible to escape the sound
Of the dark that is following around
But I just go for a walk in my mind and the light can be found
And the moment I step away
You are forced to look in and face
All the things that you've ever been without me

It is true at times, one can see you are strong
You are not at home, yet you know where you belong
You are silence now, but you are always song
I can hear you

You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say or do
Will be held against you in a court of law
So don't be such a fool
No, don't be such a fool

Don't stand too close to me, darling
Keep your hands where I can see
Don't you know you're wanted in fifty states?
I love you, dear, but it's not up to me
And it's never been quite been, you see

You are a statue, you are like a mountain
You're alive with many visions in your eyes
I understand your reason for lying
I don't condemn you for being so wise
You've only crossed the line that I'm standing beside
You've never held back before
What lover is waiting up for you tonight?
Is she another in and out of your door?
Was I another in and out of your door?

Don't stand too close to me, darling
Keep your hands where I can see
Don't you know you're wanted in fifty states?
I love you, dear, but it's not up to me
And it's never quite been, you see

...And some of the things that you've said in my ear
As you open a door and casually smile
How I have wanted to scream
Of, of all of the things
Of all of the things that enter my mind

My friend, it's hard to see you
It's easier to leave you alone
There was a time when I needed you more
My friend, it's hard to see you
It's easier to leave you alone
There was a time when I needed you more

You've been on my mind
Guess it's about time
To see things just as they were
To see things just as they were

Left so much behind
The sky opened up and I climbed
To see things just as they are
To see things just as they are

And on my way back to the ground
I was appalled by what I had found

If you dare to be
True to what you believe
There's always somebody to lose
There's always somebody to lose

Even if you try
To pull all your feelings aside
There's always someone who will see
There's always someone who will see

And on my way back to the ground
I was surprised by what I had found

No one will ever be you for yourself
Even if the world is ready to help

If you give it some time
Out of the stranger you may find
Someone that hears what you mean
Someone that hears what you mean

These thoughts are easy to think
Easy to say
But when you're walking alone
Will you be okay?

Left so much behind
The sky opened up and I climbed
To see things just as they are
To see things just as they are

And on my way back to the ground
I was appalled by what I had found
No one will ever be you for yourself
No one will ever be you for yourself

Oh my God, I need you close
Took me enough time to know
And after all the things we've seen
Together, I can't let go
Together, I can't let go

Sometimes, I have to take you in my arms
Rest your heart against my heart
Oh, you know each day it means a little more

If my love
If your love
If this love
Is pure love

Free! Love, nothing can come between
All I want is to believe
That there's no harm, it's what we need
There's no harm, it's what we need
There's no harm, it's what we need

Fear, oh, gets the best of me at night
Where is the one who holds me tight
Can only reach him in my mind
Oh, my mind

Where is my harmony?
Where is my friend?
Her voice I hear loud and clear
Only now in my head

When did the time become
Something that I feel?
And now as I disappear
Someone else becomes real
As real as the smallest star
Borne into a child
It's known that the tiniest seed
Is both simple and wild

I wish you were here with me
But you're too far away
Standing beside me now
With nothing to say

I wish that somehow you knew
Just how much you mean
That I could be for you
What you are for me
What you are for me

Where is my harmony?
Where is my friend?
Her voice I hear loud and clear
Only now in my head

When did the time become
Something that we feel?
And now as we disappear
Something else becomes real
